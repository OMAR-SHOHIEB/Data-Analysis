    ### Explanation:
    - The boxplot shows the distribution of both **Revenue** and **Customer Age**.
    - The lines in the box (whiskers) represent the range of the data, and the points outside these lines are generally considered outliers.
    - However, in this case, the data points outside the whiskers are not outliers. 
    - They represent a **normal increase in revenue**, meaning that as the **Customer Age** increases, **Revenue** tends to rise as well. This is a typical pattern and not an anomaly in the data.

    ### Explanation:
    - In the dataset, we decided to **drop** certain columns that are not important for our analysis or modeling.

        - `index`: This column likely just contains row numbers and doesn't provide meaningful information for our analysis.
        - `Column1`: This column may not contain relevant data for our analysis and can be safely removed.
        - `Year`: Depending on the context, this column may not be needed for the current analysis, so we decided to remove it.
    - After dropping these columns, we are left with a cleaner dataset containing only the relevant data.

    ### Explanation:
    - We started by converting the **"Date"** column into a **datetime** format using `pd.to_datetime()`. This ensures that the column is recognized as a proper date and allows us to perform date-related operations.
    - Then, we sorted the dataset by the **"Date"** column using `sort_values()` and reset the index to maintain a clean structure with `reset_index(drop=True)`.
    - After that, we extracted three new columns from the **"Date"** column:
        - `year`: The year part of the date.
        - `month`: The month part of the date.
        - `day`: The day part of the date.
    - These new columns will allow for easier analysis based on year, month, or day.
